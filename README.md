Deck simulator developed during [**Linkedin's "C ++ Essential Training"**](https://bw.org/cpp/) course, by **Bill Weinman**. 

<p align="center">

</p>

This project aimed to consolidate the knowledge acquired during the course, such as:

- **C ++ Basic Syntax**
- **Data Types**
- **Operator and Operators overload**
- **Functions**
- **Classes and Objects**
- **Templates and the STL**
- **I / O Streams**

I took the liberty to extrapolate a little the specifications of the final project of the course, in order to challenge myself more and to make this project a more interesting and functional example.
